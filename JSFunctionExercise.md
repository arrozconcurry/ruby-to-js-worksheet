## JavaScript Function Exercises
### Exercise #1: Create a ToDo object, with the following properties:
- `description` (string) - a description of the thing to do
- `assignee` (string) - the name of a person to do it
- `done` (boolean) - is the task done or not?
- `printStatus` (function) - print the description, assignee and status to the command line

### Exercise #2: Find the biggest number in the array
- Utilize the stub code below to complete the problem:
- `getBiggest` should accept an array as a parameter and return a the largest number in the array

```javascript
var arrayOfNums = [2, 7, 7, 3, 9, 0, 1, 6, 8, 3, 8, 4, 7, 9];

function getBiggest(array) {
  // your code goes here!!
};

//
// pass an array to getBiggest;
// get a return value that is the biggest number in the array
//
var biggest = getBiggest(arrayOfNums);
console.log("The biggest is: ", biggest);
```
